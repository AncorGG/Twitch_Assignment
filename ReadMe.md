## About The Project

The goal of this activity is to learn how to develope a quick and simple xml and a dtd,
we could choose the themes ourselves and I chose to do it about the videogame-streaming platform
Twitch. Also, part of the dificulty of this assignment was to upload it to GitHub.

## Getting Started

The way this was developed was with the use of tools such as Visual Studio Code and following the
basic structure of XML tags:

```shell
# File example:

<tag attribute"value">

content

</tag>
```

### Tools

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) - Used for developing the code.

- [Git](https://code.visualstudio.com) - Used for source code management.
